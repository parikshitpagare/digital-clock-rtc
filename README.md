# Software

To program the STM32F401xx microcontroller **STM32Cube IDE** is used without using the auto generated code. The purpose of using the CubeMX software is to generate the required HAL peripheral drivers for this application. The rest of the code is written manually.

In this application following Peripheral Drivers are used,

</p>

## Alarm Implementation

- To indicate the alarm, a buzzer and led is integrated which toggles on and off every second until the alarm stops.
- The alarm will stop automatically after 30sec or it can be stopped manually by using the dedicated push button.

# Working 

## DS1307 RTC For Time Keeping

The most important part of the clock is keep track of the time and date once the they are set by the user. 

For this purpose an external RTC module DS1307 is integrated with the microcontroller using Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication protocol. 

I2C operates in 2 modes â€“ Master mode and Slave Mode. In this application, STM32F401 acts as the master and DS1307 is the slave.The slave and master are connected using SDA and SCL lines where,

- SDA (Serial Data) : Used to read from and write to the required addresses of the DS1307 RTC module.
- SCL (Serial Clock) : Carries the clock signal based on which data transfer takes place.

<br>

This project makes use of STM32 HAL I2C drivers for I2C implementation. The API's used are as follows,

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>HAL API</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HAL_I2C_Mem_Write</td>
    <td> Write 1 byte data to a particular address of the RTC.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HAL_I2C_Mem_Read</td>
    <td>Read 1 byte data from a the particular address of the RTC</td>
</table>

<br>

A driver for the RTC module is developed to expose following different API's for easy implementation by the user,

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Driver API </th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>rtc_ds1307_init</td>
    <td>Initialize the RTC module.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>rtc_ds1307_set_time</td>
    <td> Set the time and clock mode (12h/24h).</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>rtc_ds1307_get_time</td>
    <td>Get the current time and clock mode (12h/24h)..</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>rtc_ds1307_set_cal</td>
    <td>Set the day, date, month and year.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>rtc_ds1307_get_cal</td>
    <td>Get the curren day, date, month and year.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The current time and date are fetched from RTC using timer interrupt which triggers every 1 sec.

## LCD Integration

A driver for the LCD Display is developed according to the datasheet to expose following different API's for easy implementation by the user,

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Driver API </th>
    <th>Description</th>

  </tr>
</table>


## External Interrupt Based Push Button System

To configure the different parameters like clock, calendar and alarm push buttons are implemented using the EXTI (External Interrupts) for faster and accurate response.

Since the timer interrupt executes every sec, it is required to get instant response from the button which cannot be done by simple polling mechanism. 

The interrupt based system works accurately with almost no delay giving instant response when the button is pressed.
